The goal of the project was to explore the inter-subject analysis capabilities given by the M-CCA algorithm applied to an MEG data set. To achieve this, we selected an MEG data set that contained recordings of subjects listening to naturalistic speech stimuli, so we could track the sound envelope of this stimuli with the shared space created by the M-CCA procedure. Research has demonstrated that the sound envelope is closely related to the neural activity in the auditory cortex. Using the M-CCA procedure we were able to extract the more relevant components that were active in the data, and that were shared between participants. Correlation analysis shows that the relationship between the envelope and the canonical components is similar throughout participants. When fitting a linear model using the envelope as a dependent and the canonical components as independent it shows that the components have a different predictive power and explained variance. The sound envelope shows a relationship with our components, so the envelope could be used as a reference point of recording auditory stimuli. The M-CCA procedure shows relevance for inter-subject data analysis in MEG data.
